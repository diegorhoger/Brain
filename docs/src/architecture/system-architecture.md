## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Developmental Learning
Brain AI follows a developmental approach where understanding emerges gradually:
- **Character-level foundation**: Starts with basic character prediction
- **Pattern emergence**: Discovers segments and patterns without pre-training
- **Concept formation**: Builds abstract concepts from concrete patterns
- **Rule extraction**: Formulates general rules from specific observations
- **Meta-cognitive awareness**: Develops understanding of its own knowledge

### 2. Multi-Layer Memory Architecture
The memory system mirrors human cognitive architecture:
- **Working Memory**: Active information processing and temporary storage
- **Episodic Memory**: Specific events and experiences with temporal context
- **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge and abstract concepts
- **Meta-Memory**: Knowledge about knowledge - what the system knows and doesn't know

### 3. Unified Component Interface
All components implement standardized interfaces for:
- **Configuration**: Consistent setup and parameter management
- **Operations**: Standard method signatures for core functionality
- **Metrics**: Uniform performance monitoring and reporting
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error propagation and recovery
