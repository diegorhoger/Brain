## Stage 1: Perception and Character Processing

### Character Recognition and Prediction

The cognitive journey begins with the most fundamental level of text understanding - individual characters.

**Process Flow:**
1. **Input Reception**: Raw text is received character by character
2. **Context Building**: Previous characters provide context for prediction
3. **Pattern Matching**: Character sequences are matched against learned patterns
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Each prediction receives a confidence score
5. **Learning Update**: Prediction accuracy updates internal models

**Key Components:**
- **CharacterPredictor**: GRU-based neural network for character prediction
- **CharacterVocab**: Dynamic vocabulary that grows with new characters
- **Context Window**: Sliding window of recent characters for context

**Example Process:**
```
Input: "The cat s"
Context: ["T", "h", "e", " ", "c", "a", "t", " ", "s"]
Prediction: "a" (confidence: 0.85), "i" (confidence: 0.12), "o" (confidence: 0.03)
Learning: If next character is "a", strengthen "cat s" → "a" pattern
```

### Pattern Detection

As character prediction improves, patterns emerge naturally:

**Detection Mechanisms:**
- **Frequency Analysis**: Tracks how often character sequences appear
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures predictability of character transitions
- **Context Sensitivity**: Considers surrounding characters for pattern validation
- **Temporal Patterns**: Recognizes patterns that emerge over time

## Stage 2: Segmentation and Vocabulary Building

### Dynamic Segmentation

Brain AI discovers meaningful segments without pre-defined word boundaries:

**Segmentation Process:**
1. **Frequency Tracking**: Monitor character sequence frequencies
2. **Boundary Detection**: Identify natural breaking points using entropy
3. **Segment Validation**: Confirm segments through prediction improvement
4. **Vocabulary Integration**: Add validated segments to dynamic vocabulary
5. **Usage Monitoring**: Track segment usage and effectiveness

**BPE-Style Algorithm:**
```rust
// Simplified segmentation logic
for sequence in character_sequences {
    if sequence.frequency > min_threshold {
        if entropy_at_boundaries(sequence) > entropy_threshold {
            if improves_prediction(sequence) {
                add_to_vocabulary(sequence);
                update_usage_stats(sequence);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Vocabulary Evolution

The vocabulary continuously evolves based on usage and effectiveness:

**Evolution Mechanisms:**
- **Segment Promotion**: Frequently used character sequences become segments
- **Segment Demotion**: Rarely used segments are pruned
- **Segment Merging**: Related segments can be combined
- **Segment Splitting**: Overly general segments can be specialized

## Stage 3: Memory Formation and Consolidation

### Working Memory Processing

Information first enters working memory for immediate processing:

**Working Memory Characteristics:**
- **Limited Capacity**: Typically 1000 items (configurable)
- **Priority-Based**: High-importance items stay longer
- **Temporal Decay**: Unused items fade over time
- **Active Processing**: Items can be manipulated and combined

**Processing Steps:**
1. **Intake**: New information enters with priority score
2. **Integration**: Attempts to connect with existing memories
3. **Evaluation**: Assesses importance and relevance
4. **Retention Decision**: Determines if information should be retained

### Memory Consolidation

Important information moves from working memory to long-term storage:

**Consolidation Process:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Working Memory] --> B{Importance Check}
    B -->|High| C[Episodic Memory]
    B -->|Low| D[Decay/Forget]
    C --> E{Pattern Recognition}
    E -->|Patterns Found| F[Semantic Memory]
    E -->|No Patterns| G[Remain Episodic]
    F --> H[Concept Formation]
```

**Consolidation Criteria:**
- **Frequency**: How often the information is accessed
- **Recency**: How recently the information was used
- **Importance**: Explicit importance scores
- **Connections**: How well it connects to existing knowledge

### Memory Types and Their Roles

**Working Memory:**
- Temporary storage for active processing
- Limited capacity with priority-based eviction
- Real-time integration with ongoing cognition

**Episodic Memory:**
- Specific events and experiences
- Temporal context and relationships
- Source of patterns for semantic abstraction

**Semantic Memory:**
- Abstract knowledge and concepts
- General rules and relationships
- Foundation for reasoning and prediction

## Stage 4: Concept Development and Graph Construction

### Concept Formation

Abstract concepts emerge from patterns in memory:

**Formation Process:**
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes in memories
2. **Abstraction**: Extract common features across instances
3. **Concept Creation**: Form new concept nodes in the graph
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Connect concepts based on co-occurrence
5. **Validation**: Confirm concept utility through usage

**Example Concept Formation:**
```
Episodic Memories:
- "The cat sat on the mat"
- "A cat chased the mouse"
- "Cats are good pets"

Pattern Recognition:
- "cat" appears in multiple contexts
- Associated with actions (sat, chased)
- Associated with properties (good pets)

Concept Formation:
- Create concept node "CAT"
- Properties: [animal, pet, predator]
- Relationships: [chases → MOUSE, sits_on → MAT, is_a → PET]
```

### Relationship Discovery

Concepts are connected through various relationship types:

**Relationship Types:**
- **IS_A**: Taxonomic relationships (cat IS_A animal)
- **PART_OF**: Compositional relationships (tail PART_OF cat)
- **CAUSES**: Causal relationships (rain CAUSES wet)
- **SIMILAR_TO**: Similarity relationships (cat SIMILAR_TO dog)
- **OPPOSITE_OF**: Antonym relationships (hot OPPOSITE_OF cold)
- **USED_FOR**: Functional relationships (key USED_FOR opening)

### Hebbian Learning

Relationships strengthen through repeated co-activation:

**Strengthening Mechanism:**
```rust
// Simplified Hebbian learning
fn update_relationship_strength(concept_a: &Concept, concept_b: &Concept) {
    if concept_a.is_active() && concept_b.is_active() {
        let relationship = get_relationship(concept_a, concept_b);
        relationship.weight += learning_rate * activation_product;
        relationship.last_used = current_time();
    }
}
```

**Decay Mechanism:**
- Unused relationships gradually weaken
- Very weak relationships are pruned
- Strengthening can overcome decay

## Stage 5: Rule Extraction and Knowledge Formation

### Pattern Generalization

Specific observations become general rules:

**Generalization Process:**
1. **Instance Collection**: Gather multiple similar examples
2. **Common Feature Extraction**: Identify shared characteristics
3. **Rule Formulation**: Express patterns as general rules
4. **Exception Handling**: Account for cases that don't fit
5. **Confidence Assessment**: Assign confidence based on supporting evidence

**Example Rule Formation:**
```
Observations:
- "Birds fly in the sky"
- "Eagles soar high above"
- "Sparrows flutter between trees"

Pattern: [BIRD] + [FLY/SOAR/FLUTTER] + [IN/ABOVE] + [LOCATION]

Rule: "Birds typically move through the air"
Confidence: 0.85
Exceptions: ["Penguins don't fly", "Ostriches run instead"]
```

### Causal Inference

Brain AI develops understanding of cause-and-effect relationships:

**Inference Mechanisms:**
- **Temporal Correlation**: Events that frequently occur in sequence
- **Spatial Correlation**: Events that occur in similar contexts
- **Intervention Analysis**: Understanding what changes when actions are taken
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Considering what would happen if conditions were different

### Knowledge Validation

Rules and knowledge are continuously validated:

**Validation Methods:**
- **Prediction Accuracy**: How well rules predict outcomes
- **Consistency Checking**: Ensuring rules don't contradict each other
- **Evidence Accumulation**: Gathering supporting or contradicting evidence
- **Peer Review**: Comparing with other learned rules

## Stage 6: Simulation and Prediction

### Scenario Construction

Brain AI can construct and explore hypothetical scenarios:

**Construction Process:**
1. **Initial State Setup**: Define starting conditions
2. **Rule Application**: Apply learned rules to predict changes
3. **Branching Exploration**: Consider multiple possible outcomes
4. **Constraint Validation**: Ensure scenarios remain plausible
5. **Outcome Assessment**: Evaluate final states and their likelihood

### Prediction and Planning

The system can predict outcomes and plan actions:

**Prediction Pipeline:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Current State] --> B[Apply Rules]
    B --> C[Generate Possibilities]
    C --> D[Prune Implausible]
    D --> E[Score Outcomes]
    E --> F[Select Best Path]
    F --> G[Action Recommendation]
```

**Planning Capabilities:**
- **Goal-Oriented**: Work backward from desired outcomes
