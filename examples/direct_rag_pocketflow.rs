        // Direct answer to "What are the 3 unique architecture patterns"
        "The 3 unique architecture patterns in PocketFlow are: 1) Node-Flow Architecture - separates processing logic (Nodes) from execution orchestration (Flows), 2) Async Parallel Processing - enables concurrent LLM operations through AsyncFlow and ParallelBatchNode, and 3) Batch Optimization Framework - groups multiple LLM requests to reduce API costs.",
        
        // Direct answer to Node-Flow implementation
        "PocketFlow implements the Node-Flow architecture pattern by using BaseNode as the fundamental abstraction for all processing units, and Flow classes to orchestrate execution. Nodes contain the processing logic while Flows handle the sequencing and coordination. This separation allows for modular, reusable components that can be chained together.",
        
        // Direct answer to BatchNode purpose
        "BatchNode and ParallelBatchNode in PocketFlow are used to optimize LLM API costs and improve efficiency. BatchNode groups multiple requests into batches to reduce the number of individual API calls. ParallelBatchNode adds concurrent processing to handle multiple batches simultaneously, further improving throughput and reducing latency.",
        
        // Direct answer to agent-based workflows
        "PocketFlow enables agent-based workflows through its 'Agents build Agents' design philosophy. The framework provides abstractions that allow autonomous agents to create and orchestrate other agents. This enables recursive and self-improving AI systems where agents can spawn new agents, coordinate multi-agent tasks, and build complex agent hierarchies.",
        
        // Direct answer to 100-line framework
        "PocketFlow is called a 100-line framework because it provides essential LLM orchestration capabilities in approximately 100 lines of Python code. This minimalist design philosophy focuses on core functionality without bloat, making the framework easy to understand, modify, and extend while maintaining powerful features for AI workflow orchestration.",
        
        // Direct answer to LLM cost optimization
        "PocketFlow optimizes LLM API costs through several mechanisms: BatchNode groups multiple requests to take advantage of batch pricing, ParallelBatchNode enables concurrent processing to reduce wait times, and the framework minimizes redundant API calls through efficient request management. This can significantly reduce costs compared to individual request patterns.",
        
        // Direct answer to key classes and components
        "The key classes and components in PocketFlow are: BaseNode (base processing unit for all operations), Flow (synchronous orchestrator for sequential execution), AsyncFlow (asynchronous orchestrator for non-blocking operations), BatchNode (batch processor for cost optimization), and ParallelBatchNode (parallel batch processor for concurrent operations). These components work together to create flexible AI workflows.",
        
        // Direct answer to use cases
        "PocketFlow's main use cases and applications include: LLM workflow orchestration for complex AI pipelines, agent-based AI systems for autonomous operations, batch processing of AI tasks for cost efficiency, parallel LLM operations for high throughput, cost-optimized AI pipelines for production environments, and rapid prototyping of AI agents for research and development.",
        
        // Additional context
        "PocketFlow uses Python with async/await patterns for non-blocking operations. The framework supports error handling, fallback mechanisms, and flexible configuration. It's designed for both research and production environments, providing a balance between simplicity and powerful functionality.",
        
        // Technical implementation details
        "PocketFlow's implementation leverages Python's asyncio library for asynchronous operations, uses class inheritance for node specialization, and implements the observer pattern for flow coordination. The framework maintains clean separation of concerns between data processing (nodes) and execution control (flows).",
