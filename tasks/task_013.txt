# Task ID: 13
# Title: Conversational Intelligence Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides natural language conversational capabilities while maintaining Brain AI's core cognitive architecture.
# Details:
Implement a three-phase hybrid strategy: Phase 1 - Use Brain AI as the Retrieval engine with external LLM as Generation engine; Phase 2 - Collect high-quality conversation data; Phase 3 - Train specialized Brain AI conversational model to achieve full independence from external LLMs. This strategic priority provides natural language capabilities while maintaining Brain's cognitive architecture and working toward the original vision of fully independent AI intelligence.

# Test Strategy:
Test RAG orchestrator with various conversation contexts. Verify knowledge retrieval accuracy from Brain's memory systems. Test response quality and factual grounding. Measure conversation coherence and context retention. Validate training data collection and model performance improvements.
