- **Memory System**: Working, episodic, and semantic memory with consolidation
- **Concept Graph**: Dynamic knowledge representation with relationship learning
- **Insight Extraction**: Pattern detection and rule formalization
- **Simulation Engine**: Branching scenario simulation and prediction
- **Meta-Memory**: Self-awareness and confidence tracking
- **Novelty Detection**: Content novelty assessment and curiosity-driven learning

### Integration Layer (Task 10.1 - COMPLETED âœ…)
- **Unified Interfaces**: Standardized traits for configuration, operations, and metrics
- **Data Exchange**: Unified data structures and routing system
- **Component Registry**: Dependency-aware component management
- **Workflow Engine**: Declarative workflow execution
- **API Layer**: Consistent interfaces across all components
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time system health and performance tracking

### Infrastructure
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based security with role-based access
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request throttling and quotas
- **Logging & Analytics**: Comprehensive event tracking and analysis
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and optimization recommendations
- **Export System**: Data export in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, GraphML)
